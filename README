  written in the style of the heapq[1] library, and inspired by the

    >>> import vclock
    >>> vclock.from_size(3)
    (0, 0, 0)
    >>> vclock.merge((1, 2), (3, 2))
    (3, 2)
    >>> [vclock.compare(a, b) for a, b in [
        [(1, 1), (1, 2)],
        [(1, 1), (1, 1)],
        [(1, 1), (1, 0)],
        [(1, 2), (2, 1)],
        ]]
    [-1, 0, 1, 0]
    >>> vclock.sort([(1, 2), (3, 2)], reverse=True)
    [(3, 2), (1, 2)]
    >>> vclock.is_concurrent((1, 2), (2, 1))
    True
    >>> vclock.increment((0, 1), 0)
    (1, 1)
